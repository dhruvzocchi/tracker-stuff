Code used to track larval zebrafish in the tracking microscopy system. 'BrainLocator.py' contains functions used to track the x-y positions of swimming larvae. 'zTrackFunction.py' contains functions used to track the z position. 




example of raw output from the light field microscope during a minute long free swimming experiment. What is being imaged is GCaMP7f signal from every neuron in the larval brain. The video is cropped to show central 16 subimages (of 64 total)
